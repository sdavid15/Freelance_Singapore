The model must be either a Linear Regression Logistic Regression Machine Learning using Linear/Logistic Regression K-means clustering model KNN classification model

Insights:
1) The Price range between $730000 to $1983000 is the most frequent rate for housing metrics i.e. approximately 88%.
2) The most popular Unit Price preferred for purchase ranges between $1000 to $2000.

13) Tenure 99 yrs lease commencing from 1983 and 999999 yrs lease commmencing from 1960 are statistically significant.
14) Type of Sale as Resale is most statistically significant.
15) The other variables that are statistically signficant are No of Units, Area Sqft.


Model Prediction:
In the Gradient Boost Regression Model, apprx. 98% of the variation in Price is well explained by the independent variables Project Name. Street Name, Type, Postal District, Market Segment, Tenure, Type of Sale, No of Units, Sqft Area, Floor Level, Unit Price, Sale Month and Day.
